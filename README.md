This project looks at the use of JavaScript, Node and HTML to create a basic web page. Two datasets containing flights and airports information from OpenFlights were used for the code. The web page allows for simple filtering and analysis of this information with user interaction. The report covers how the data was loaded, mapped, analysed, used on the web page, tested and created with functional JavaScript in mind.
